programming skills that openDMD used:
    1. linux syslog: for the log utility;
    2. linux V4L2 API: for capturing picture from video camera;
    3. config file mechanism: for making program configurable;
    4. linux signal mechanism: for signal handling;
    5. linux directory and file operation;
    6. multiple thread programming, including synchronization, communicaiton.
    7. multiple process, including signal handling, fork, etc.
    8. bisic graph transformation: rgb888, packed yuyv422, planar yuyv422p, 
                                   planar yuyv420p, etc.
    9. flv video format specification.

    12. linux networking programming: epoll, socket, http protocol, etc;
    13. sqlite database, manual and C API;

programming ideas:
    1. add Qt UI to render video frame on client local or server end;
    2. using event loop module to do ipc. take a look at libevent/Qt.
